# Zero Hunger Pantry Planner

## Problem Statement

Millions of individuals living with chronic health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease face daily challenges in accessing nutritious, affordable meals. These challenges are compounded by limited food options, lack of dietary knowledge, and financial constraints. Traditional recipe apps often assume access to a wide range of ingredients and overlook the realities of food insecurity.

**Zero Hunger Pantry Planner** aims to bridge this gap by offering personalized, health-conscious meal suggestions based on what users already have in their pantry. By combining dietary guidelines with real-time ingredient matching, the app empowers users to make informed food choices without needing to shop for expensive or unfamiliar items.
